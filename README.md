*plot1* uses the base package to depict total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. This graph should help answer the question: "Have total emissions of PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?"


*plot2* uses the base package to depict total emissions of PM2.5 at Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") in the years  1999 to 2008.  This graph shoulud help answer the question "Have emissions of PM2.5 decreased in Baltimore City, Maryland?"


*plot3* uses ggplot2 package to depict emissions recorded at the Baltimore monitoring site broken down by emission source type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad). # This graph should help answer the question:
"Which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999â€“2008 for Baltimore City?"
