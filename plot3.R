# *plot3* uses ggplot2 package to depict emissions recorded at the Baltimore monitoring site
# broken down by emission source type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad).  
# This graph should help answer the question:
# "Which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999â€“2008 for Baltimore City?"
